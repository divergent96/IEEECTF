Here a file is given in chinese adn needs to be decrypted to get the flag.

Tried translating it but it didnot work.

Now trying frequency analysis but I dont know how to do it properly.

I stumbled upon the program SCBsolvr which did the work for me.

The text was from ALice in Wonderland and it turns out that the flag is the title of the book

Flag == ALICE IN WONDERLAND
