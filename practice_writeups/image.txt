By a clue I analysed its hex using an online tool.(Can use a inbuilt tool also somethinh=g string or so)

It gave a key and told us to guess it.

guessing its sternography

now using outguess command $ outguess -k "my secret key" -d hidden.txt demo.jpg out.jpg

we get the text file with gibberish data

run it through online shift cipher solver to get flag
