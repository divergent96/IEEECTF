Here an image was given.
Image search didnot reveal anything.
By a clue I analysed its hex using an online tool at en.webhex.net
(Can use a inbuilt tool also somethinhg string or so)

At the end of file you will find
K="KhtgduHjj"Guess?

It gave a key and told us to guess how to use it.

I guessed it to be sternography

Now using outguess command "$ outguess -k <my secret key> -d image.jpg hidden.txt"

We get the text file with gibberish data as "Jbhun_Hlbh_S0HhaQ_GU3_SyNnt0K_=="

This is shifted by 13 using shift cipher.

Run it through online shift cipher solver to get flag

Flag ==: Wouha_Uyou_F0UunD_TH3_FlAag0X_==
