There was a jar file which was to be run in command line using java command.

It asked for A number and if correct returned a flag.

using jd-gui i opened the class file of the jar and it was revealed that answer was 1545686892/5 in rounded value.

Another option is that two strings are xored for the flag so if we xor them it will give the flag.

Flag == a7b08c546302cc1fd2a4d48bf2bf2ddb
