Here we see the name is directly aken and put inside the php text.

Input name and we see it enters a tmp directory and creates a new page.

But our pass file is in base directory and so we have to list the base directory.

So we will put in a SSI command to execute a command in bash shell which will list base directory.

Put in this "<!--#exec cmd="ls ../">" in name field.

this will fetch the name of pass file.

open the file "https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/basic/8/au12ha39vc.php"
