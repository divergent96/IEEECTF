We had to open shell and type a given netcat command.
It mentioned addition of two positive numbers is negative number.
First I tried a ridiculously large number.
As an error it displayed that largest java number is something(*dnt remember)
So basically adding it will result in change of the sign bit in binary and it worked

flag==That_was_easssy!
