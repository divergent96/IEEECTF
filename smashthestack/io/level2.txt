In level2 the source code is already given to us.

On reading through source code we see we need to make it run catcher function to get the access.

Also we need to get the SIGFPE(signal floating point exception) to do so.

as we can see below that there is code to do the same by argv[1]/argv[2]

but also another condition to run the catcher is that argv[2]!=0

To do so now we need to do a buffer overflow.

Now on the function page of SIGFPE we see that there is another number dividing by which buffer overflow is achieved.

We need to divide -1 by the most negative number ie -2^(31)

input 
./level02 -2147483648 -1

Output:-WIN

level03 pass == IFd92yzOnSMv9tkX
